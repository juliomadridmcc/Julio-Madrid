## Introduction to the Laser D project

The primary goal of the Laser D project is to extract and index corporate document files from your libraryâ€™s Laser D collection within 9-12 months of starting. These files must be transferred from compact discs and saved electronically. Academic libraries across the U.S are funding resources to accomplish this endeavor, including the hiring of paid interns.

The Laser D collection contains U.S. and international reports from publicly filing companies. MBA students need these reports for their academic research, but these documents are in danger of erasure due to the obsolescence of their media and software.

The Laser D software contains indiscernible code that prevents access to Laser D files on the CDs. A recent programming breakthrough enables the extraction and indexing of these files for electronic access. Upon completion of this project, graduate students can access the entire collection of reports.

## Background on Laser D

Laser D is a computer-based document storage system that provides access to important corporate documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Laser D combines image-scanning technology with the high-storage capacity of CDs. 

The significance of Laser D stems from it being the main source for reports following the cessation of Disclosure microfiche subscriptions in 1992, and partly because it preceded mandated electronic report filings with the SEC in the late 1990s. As a result, a single collection may contain millions of reports.

## Corporate report filings

CDs contain U.S. and international public company reports from 11,000 filing public companies. 

### Report types

Laser D includes the following report types: 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, 6-Ks, 10-Cs, N-1Rs, ARSs, and proxy statements (See Table 1).

Report Type | Description
----------|-----------
10-Ks | Annual business and financial reports.
10-Qs | Quarterly income statements and balance sheets. 
8-Ks | Unscheduled material events.
6-Ks | Unscheduled material events and/or financials for foreign filers.
10-Cs | Changes in name or number of NASDAQ-listed securities.
N-1Rs | Annual or semi-annual report for registered investment companies.
ARSs | Annual reports to shareholders.
